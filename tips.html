<p>Control the corners. Most players go for the middle
    space whenever they can, but don't ignore the corners!
    You can use the corners to set up multiple winning moves
    at once, leaving your opponent no way to block your win.<br><br>
    Watch your opponent. Take note of where they place their 
    O’s. Keep your eyes open for those winning spots so you can 
    block them before they get three in a row. Bigger grid,
    The rules are the same, except now you’ll be looking to 
    get four in a row. It’s best to control the center when 
    playing on the bigger board. Since there are five squares 
    in each row and column, putting your X’s three adjacent spots
    will give you two possible winning moves, leaving your 
    opponent in a trap.
