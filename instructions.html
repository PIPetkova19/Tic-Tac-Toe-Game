<p> You are X’s and your opponent is O’s. On your turn, click <br><br>
    anywhere on the grid to place an X in that square. Your goal<br><br>
    is to get three in a row before your opponent does. Try your<br><br>
    skills getting four in a row on the 5x5 grid for an extra<br><br>
    challenge. If things are still too easy, take it up a notch <br><br>
    by switching to hard mode! You can play against a computer,<br><br>
    or with a friend on the same computer. <br><br>
